# Git Basics

Passed.
First I was confused about git and all these commands, now it has become more clear for me. Hope to become confident git user during using it while working under the projects.
I passed [learngitbranching.js.org](https://github.com/GavryshSergii/kottans-frontend/blob/main/learngitbranching.js.org) and finished all nesessary tasks for this level.
