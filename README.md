# Git Basics

Passed.
At first I was confused by git and all these commands, especially when the examples were given in Python. Now, after a two-week course and watching additional videos, it became more clear to me. I hope to become a confident git user when working on my future projects.
I have passed all nesessary tasks at [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).
